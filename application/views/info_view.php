<h1>About FOOTPRINTED.org</h1>
<p>Our database will contain environmental and social impact information for resources, processes and products. This information will be stored as linked data so that it is compatible with existing (and emerging) standards for sustainability accounting. Our database will be accessible remotely through an API, published as Open Data, and accessible through an App Garden of specialized sustainability software. </p>
<p>Creating and nurturing a community of environmental experts that create, discuss and evaluate the data. Giving them the technological affordances and the motivation to open up their data and share.</p>
<p>Our goal is to ensure sustainability and greater impact environmental related data should be open, transparent, community driven and free to use. This data should be accessible and mashable through APIs. Open standards are needed for the growing ecosystem of sustainability information.</p>
